# LP Gas Leak, Smoke, and Temperature Monitoring System

This repository contains the code for a security system that detects LP gas leaks, smoke, and high room temperatures using an ESP32 microcontroller. The system is designed to alert the user via WhatsApp text messages in case of any of these hazards and can trigger warning lights, automatic exhaust fans, and warning sounds on-site to ensure prompt action is taken.

## Features

- Detects LP gas leaks, smoke, and high room temperatures.
- Sends alert notifications to the user via WhatsApp text messages.
- Triggers warning lights, automatic exhaust fans, and warning sounds on-site.
- Provides an effective and reliable solution for ensuring safety in households and commercial spaces.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, you'll need the following:

- ESP32 microcontroller board.
- LP gas sensor module.
- Smoke sensor module.
- Temperature sensor module.
- A valid WhatsApp account with access to the Twilio API for sending messages.
- Arduino IDE or any other compatible development environment.


## Usage

When the system detects an LP gas leak, smoke, or high room temperature, it will send a WhatsApp text message alert to the configured phone number. Additionally, the system will trigger the warning lights, automatic exhaust fans, and warning sounds on-site to prompt immediate action.

Ensure that the ESP32 microcontroller is connected to the internet and the phone number for receiving WhatsApp alerts is correctly configured in the code.
